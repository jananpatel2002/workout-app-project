# workout-app-project
A project that I worked on with Kevin Ngo. We are aiming to create a simple app that allows a user to get a certain idea of what workouts they should do based on the body part

We are planning to make this a nice app that anyone can use to get a gist of what workout to do. We are planning to add a GUI using the Python TKINTER class
